Follow the instructions for [configuring the Watson Assistant settings](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.0?topic=assistant-configuring-watson-settings) in the system administration workspace.\n2. Retrieve the setting from your Watson Assistant > `Integratations` > `Web chat`.\n3. Click the `Embed` tab to retrieve the values for the `integrationID`, `region` and `serviceInstanceID`.\n\n![webchat-settings](../../images/webchat-settings.png)\n\n<Caption fullWidth>\n\n*Figure 1: The Watson Assistant settings.*\n\n</Caption>\n\n## The Watson Assistant chatbot does not start\n\nIf the Watson Assistant chatbot does not start, delete the JWT certificate and the associated jar in your JAVA_HOME directory.

From the `JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext` directory, delete the `jwtcert.cer` and the `JWTCryptoConfig.jar` files.\n2. Run the build `configtest` target that is specified in [generating the JWT keystore and certificates](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.0?topic=assistant-generating-jwt-keystore-certificates).\nThis will generate a new keystore and self-signed certificate.\n3. Follow the steps for [adding the public key to Watson Assistant](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.0?topic=certificates-adding-public-key-watson-assistant).\n4. If the public certificate was already imported into the application server's truststore, follow the steps to [re-import the public certificate](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.0?topic=assistant-configuring-application-servers-json-web-tokens).\nThis applies to deployments on IBM Websphere and IBM Websphere Liberty only.\n\n![wa-security-public-key](../../images/wa-security-public-key.png)\n\n<Caption fullWidth>\n\n*Figure 3: Adding the public key to the Watson Assistant web chat security.*\n\n</Caption>\n\n## Browser console common errors\n\nWhen you view the IBM Watson Assistant chatbot in your browser window, it is useful to open up the browser console window to view any logs that are outputted.\n\n### The public cert is not added to my Watson Assistant\n\nIf the public cert is not added to Watson Assistant, follow the steps for [adding the public key to Watson Assistant](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.0?topic=certificates-adding-public-key-watson-assistant).\n\n![wa-browser-console-cert-missing](../../images/wa-browser-console-cert-missing.png)\n\n<Caption fullWidth>\n\n*Figure 4: The public key is missing in the Watson Assistant web chat security.*\n\n</Caption>\n\n### The incorrect settings are specified\n\nWhen you update the Watson Assistant settings in the system administration workspace, you might inadvertently miss a setting or add the wrong value.
