## Option 1: IBM Watson™ Assistant as Service on IBM public cloud

The following figure outlines the first option for deploying IBM Watson™ Assistant (WA) as a Service on IBM public cloud. Where needed and decided by the customer, a virtual private network (VPN) can be included.

The following list outlines the possible challenges that are associated with this option:

1. It might require data to be shared outside the country or state.
2. The case data is logged in WA as it is a public cloud.

## Option 2a: IBM Watson™ Assistant in private cloud

The following figure outlines the option where you can deploy WA in a private cloud that is either hosted by a cloud provider or within the customer’s own data center.

## Option 2b: IBM Watson™ Assistant in private cloud (co-deployed with SPM)

This is similar to the preceding option, except that WA is  co-deployed with SPM in a private cloud that is either hosted by a cloud provider or within the customer’s own data center.

Therefore, you don’t need a VPN for the interactions between WA and SPM. The following figure shows how SPM could be deployed on OpenShift as well.
