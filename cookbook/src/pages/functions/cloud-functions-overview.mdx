IBM Cloudâ„¢ Functions is a Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) platform, allowing for the connection and extension of cloud services.
With IBM Cloud Functions, you can create stateless code snippets, called actions, that are set to perform one specific task.

### How are IBM Cloud Functions actions used in the Virtual Assistant

The sample IBM Watson Assistant dialog skill provided is configured  to trigger a webhook. A webhook is a HTTP POST request to a URL specified in the webhook definition.
Because many of the APIs in SPM used to retrieve data are GET requests, an intermediate service that accepts a POST request is required. This is achieved using IBM Cloud Functions actions.

The sample code provided contains a number of files to be used as IBM Cloud Functions actions.
When invoked from IBM Watson Assistant, these actions will make a REST API call to SPM to retrieve the necessary data required to assist the caseworker.

See the [Architecture overview](/architecture/arch-overview) for more details on how IBM Cloud Functions integrates with IBM Watson Assistant and IBM Social Program Management.
