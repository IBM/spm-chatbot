## Unable to view end of the logs

To view all the logs outputted, the scroll appears to scroll between the transactions and does not allow you to view the end of the logs outputted for the individual transactions.

To view all the logs, highlight the end of the logs that are shown and press SHIFT + Down Arrow. You can now scroll down by using the keyboard to view all the logs that are outputted for that transaction.
