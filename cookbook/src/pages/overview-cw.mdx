## Case-specific or Person-specific data

As a caseworker, you can get case-specific or person-specific information by using the chatbot. Use the chatbot to quickly answer citizen questions and access information on a case without navigating through multiple pages for the information.

You can access data without navigating to the case or person of interest. If extra details are needed, you can navigate to the page of interest by using a link in the chatbot.

## Services support

Agencies, by using Lab Services, are empowered to retrieve SPM case-specific data by using secure chatbot integration, by using existing or new APIs, or by building on sample dialog skills that were created for outstanding verifications.

## Process guides

You can access process guides by using the chatbot. The chatbot can guide you through a process while the chatbot is working on it. This removes the need to access documentation that is external to the application.
