The following list outlines the two ways that the Virtual Assistant is designed to assist caseworkers:

1. Querying data by searching for outstanding verifications by case or by client.
2. Understanding caseworker procedures related to updating client details for a change in income or address.

The following lists the two ways that the user can engage with the Virtual Assistant:

* The user can type a free text question, case reference and number or identification type and number into the text field.
* The user can click one of the options that are provided by the Virtual Assistant that prompts the user to enter more information about what they want to find.

The Virtual Assistant can recognize different variations of how users enter information.
