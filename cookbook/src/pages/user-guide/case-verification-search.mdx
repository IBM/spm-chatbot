Users can view outstanding verifications on a case in two ways.

## Free text a question, case reference or number into the text field

In the example where a user is seeking an Integrated Case number 260, the user can type this information in the text field. The Virtual Assistant can recognize different variations of how the user enters this information.

For example, the user might type it as `260 Integrated Case`, `IC 260`, `Case 260`, `260 Case Ref`. Similarly, the user might type it as a question.

For example, `Show me outstanding verifications for IC 260?`, `What needs to be verified for Integrated Case 260?`, `Can I see verifications on Case 260?`, and many other variations of the information and question.

The Virtual Assistant displays the case that is found by using the information that is provided. The user must then select whether it is the correct case.

If the user clicks `Yes, it's the right case` the outstanding verifications on this case are displayed in the chat window. In addition to listing the outstanding verifications on the case, the Virtual Assistant has options that the user can click.

The following list outlines the options that are displayed:

* See outstanding verifications for case 260.
* See notes for case 260.

When the user clicks either option, the page opens in the application.

If the user wants to continue to use the Virtual Assistant, the user can type another question or entity type and number or else click one of the provided options.

The following list outlines the options that are displayed to the user:

* Try another case.
* Start again.
* I've got what I need thanks.

The three options are also provided if the case that is displayed by the Virtual Assistant is not the correct case.

## Click the Outstanding verifications by case option

By clicking the Outstanding verifications by case option, the Virtual Assistant is prompted to ask for the case number the user is searching for.

When the user enters the case number, the Virtual Assistant displays the case that it finds by using the information that is provided and the user must then select whether it is the correct case.

If the user clicks `Yes, it's the right case`, the outstanding verifications for this case are displayed in the chat window. In addition to listing the outstanding verifications on the case, the Virtual Assistant displays options that the user can click.
