After you determine the high-level purpose of your chatbot, define the bots Minimum Viable Knowledge (MVK).
When you are designing your first chatbot, it’s best to keep this simple and try not to be overly ambitious.
The MVK lists the topics that need to be covered (topic breadth) and the depth of information in each of these topic (topic depth).

Based on your research, list  the topics that you think your bot should cover. You can run these as Design Thinking workshops by bringing your team together to ideate, cluster, and prioritize the topics that should be included.

For example, if you design a chatbot for a grocery store you might cover topics such as locations, opening hours, this week’s deals, and so on. The fewer and more focused your topics, the more likely that your chatbot succeeds.
