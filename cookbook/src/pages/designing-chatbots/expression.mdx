Expression is designing the chatbot's personality. The personality of the chatbot needs to closely align to the brand of your solution. There are multiple ways to come up with the personality for your chatbot.

The following list outlines the questions that IBM Design suggests that you ask:

* How social is it?
* How open and up front is it?
* How agreeable is it?
* How thoughtful is it?
* How moody is it?
* How excitable is it?
* How professional is it?
* What kind of character is it?
* How would it react in negative or hostile situation?
* What medium will it use?
* What is it not like?

Understanding the personality of the chatbot enables you to use the imaginary voice that the chatbot will have in the design of your conversation.
