IBM® Cúram Social Program Management (SPM) was enhanced in version 8.0 to support integration with IBM® Watson Assistant for the caseworker application.

Caseworkers can ask about outstanding verifications on a case or client, or ask about common caseworker procedures.

This **Cookbook** provides you with sample dialog skills, cloud functions, and guidance so you can quickly set up your own virtual assistant.

First, configure SPM to set up the IBM Watson Assistant integration. Then download and deploy the sample skills and cloud functions to IBM Watson Assistant to get the sample caseworker assistant up and running.
