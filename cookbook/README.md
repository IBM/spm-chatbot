# IBM CÃºram Social Program Management (SPM) Virtual Assistant sample application and cookbook

This repository contains the assets and the cookbook to integrate SPM with IBM Watson Assistant.

The cookbook is available at this URL: [https://merative.github.io/spm-chatbot]([https://ibm.github.io/spm-chatbot/](https://merative.github.io/spm-chatbot))

The cookbook is built using Gatsby. To build the cookbook locally, please run the following steps:
- clone the repository to your local machine (using 'git clone' from command line).
- cd to the cookbook directory.
- run 'npm install' from the command line. This will download all required libraries.
- (we do not keep a package-lock.json file under source control, so all dependency versions are determined by the libraries specified in the package.json file. Please do not add a package-lock.json file to the repository.)
- run 'npm run dev' to build and deploy a local version of the cookbook.
- the cookbook may then be viewed at `http://localhost:8000`
- Refer to the official Gatbsy documentation for futher information.
